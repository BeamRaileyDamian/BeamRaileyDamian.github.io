In this exercise, we made our own github page while practicing git commands and branch manipulations. There are three branches: main, favorites, and extra, where main and favorites are identical since they were merged. We made use of basic html and css files.

I had initial trouble in using git commands but consulted by notes to get through.

Note: main and favorites are not shown to be in the same level in network because I pushed README.md in main after merging it with favorites. Also, i do not know why but there is no "2 branches merged" in the commit history even if I did the merging.
